  Needed:  Better alarm card - horizontal layout for horizontal touchscreen    --OR--  --INSTEAD--
  Needed:  Change Touchscreen and keypad PI to vertical layout
  Needed:  Use speakers on touchpad RPI for countdown alerts, siren, etc

CIRT security notes:

Alarm System Security Controls
 
Discussion 08/26/2024
 
1. All components of the alarm systems will live on the VLAN designated for alarms in critical space
2. Splunk will be the only national product installed on the alarm systems
3. The alarm systems will never run an in-place update / upgrade (due to the risk of not coming back up)
4. All updates / upgrades will be run on a prototype and tested before going into production
5. Direct inbound access to the alarms will be available only from privileged desktops
6. Direct outbound access from the alarms will only be permitted to:
	a. An internal logging server
	b. The Splunk server on the DCN and potentially
	c. The internal SMTP server or another internal noticing server
7. Access restrictions will be imposed at all possible levels - Host based firewall, ACLs and at the Palos
8. The introduction of a permanent prototype adds the requirement for procurement of an additional set of equipment
9. Discussion is still needed on the following:
	a. Where the prototype will reside
	b. How to handle the different components to be updated / upgraded & the upgrade processes
	c. The format of the syslog / Splunk messages and how to process them.
	d. What alerts do we want and are there any that cannot be handled by Splunk?
