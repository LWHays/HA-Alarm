    (I did try the first one, but only got as far as .config/wayfire.ini, which I couldn't find anywhere...)

Using abqtouchpad user on the pi and in HA

I seemed to have a lot of trouble because I created my "hays" user first, so I re-imaged the microSD with the current
raspberry pi OS and created abqtouchpad first.    I did go through a screen resize setup step with the wrong screen connected, 
so I may have to re-do that.   I enabled pi connect, so far ssh is disabled and we still need rfkill.

note that you should be logged in as the autologin user if/when you run raspi-config for autologin

This all worked.

Logged in to HA as abqtouchpad and modified preferences / HA default view.   These are saved as cookies, so you have to be 
on the account and browser you are intending to modify for it to save.   

This worked.

Next problems:
ABQtouchpad HA display is too small.
touchpad pi needs to beep when pending armed or pending triggered
touchpad pi needs to scream when triggered.
