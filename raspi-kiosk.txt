Using abqtouchpad user on the pi and in HA

I seemed to have a lot of trouble because I created my "hays" user first, so I re-imaged the microSD with the current
raspberry pi OS and created abqtouchpad first.    I did go through a screen resize setup step with the wrong screen connected, 
so I may have to re-do that.   I enabled pi connect, so far ssh is disabled and we still need rfkill.
